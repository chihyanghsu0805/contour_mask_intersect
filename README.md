Users can develop extensions via MATLAB and java using MIM's objects.

## Compute Intersect
This extension computes the volume of intersection for all contours in a RTst. \
The output is a csv file with a upper triangle matrix format.

## Compute Integral Dose
This extension computes the integral dose for each contour given a RTDose and a RTst. \
The output is a csv file with each structure and its integral dose.
